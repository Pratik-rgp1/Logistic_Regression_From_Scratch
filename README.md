# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement **Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy**, applied to DMV written test data. It includes visualization, cost function implementation, gradient descent, decision boundary plotting, and prediction on unseen data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: `DMV_Written_Tests.csv`
- Features: `DMV_Test_1`, `DMV_Test_2`
- Target: `Results` (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implements **logistic sigmoid function** manually
- Derives and minimizes **cost function and gradient**
- Performs **gradient descent**
- Visualizes:
  - Data points (passed vs. failed)
  - Convergence of cost function
  - Decision boundary
- Predicts result for new inputs
